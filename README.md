# 🧠 Advice Generator App

The **Advice Generator App** is a responsive and interactive web application that provides random pieces of advice using the **Advice Slip API**.  
It is built with clean HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on user experience and smooth animations.

## 📖 About the Project

This project was built as part of a frontend challenge to practice:

- Responsive design
- API integration
- UI animations
- Clean project structure

Users can generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice button, with visual feedback provided through hover, click, and loading animations.

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 Generate random advice on button click
- 📱 Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- ✨ Button click animation for better interaction
- ⏳ Loading animation while fetching data
- 🔄 Real-time advice fetched from an external API
- ♿ Semantic and accessible HTML structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, custom properties, animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Fetch API, async/await
- **Advice Slip API** – External advice provider

---
## ⚙️ How It Works

- When the page loads, a random advice slip is fetched from the Advice Slip API.
- Clicking the dice button:
  - Triggers a loading animation
  - Fetches a new piece of advice
  - Updates the advice ID and text dynamically
- Animations and transitions improve user feedback and usability.
